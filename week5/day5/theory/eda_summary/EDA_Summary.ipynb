    "Rarely will you be given a data set without any missing values. There are many representations of missing data. In databases, they are NULL values; certain programming languages use NA; and depending on where you get your data, missing values can be an empty string, '', or even numeric values such as 88 or 99. Pandas displays missing values as NaN.\n",

    "Learning about apply is fundamental in the data cleaning process. It also encapsulates key concepts in programming, mainly writing functions. apply takes a function and “applies” (i.e., runs it) across each row or column of a dataframe “simultaneously.” If you’ve programmed before, then the concept of an “apply” should be familiar. It is similar to writing a for loop across each row or column and calling the function—apply just does it simultaneously. In general, this is the preferred way to apply functions across dataframes, because it typically is much faster than writing a for loop in Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the biggest reasons for using Pandas is its ability to work with time-series data. We observed some of this capability earlier, when we concatenated data in Chapter 4 and saw how the indices automatically aligned themselves. This chapter focuses on the more common tasks when working with data that involve dates and times.\n",
